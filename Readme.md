# Our Paws
Our Paws is an react native application, that main purpose to try and predict the temperature of the ground for dogs safety. 
- at 49 Degrees skin destruction within a minute
- at 60 Degrees to paws
- at 65 Degrees damage within seconds
<br>
The main idea, is to create an application that will help users inform what will happen and what type of surface to avoid for the health and safetly of the dogs <br> <br>
Currently working on creating a remote temperature sensor to make accurate readings and add them firebase database that will add to my collection. 

is currently working on its latest update. You can check out the app, on the google play store <br>

 This is current update and new look that will be rolling out later <br> 
 

## Current Update 
- [x] Add New Layout
- [x] Add Better Search Results 
- [ ] Add Pop ups to Inform Users (Like in the first v1)
- [ ] Add Reclickable to last search (Async Storage)
- [ ] Create a better Junit Test plan for testing predictions
- [ ] Create ISO Version


## Future goals
- [ ] Create Remote Temperature Sensor
- [ ] Create Neural Network For Predictions
- [ ] Get a large collection of data from Temperature Sensor
- [ ] Make a better test plans that will make the neural network great
- [ ] Maybe the idea of creating an api
